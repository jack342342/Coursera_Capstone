    "London is the epicentre of diversity in the United Kingdom which is reflected in the city's catering service; bringing a myriad of different global cuisines to the economic forefront, many of which being family-run businesses. It may be possible to draw correlations between the demographics of certain parts of London with how successful certain ethnic businesses. If this is the case, then it may also be possible to explore if there are any cases which seem to follow suit and as such find regions of London which may have untapped market potential."
